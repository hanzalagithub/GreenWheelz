Green Wheelz

Green Wheelz is an innovative project that combines technology and sustainability to revolutionize urban mobility. The platform integrates IoT devices, such as the ESP32 LilyGO board with built-in SIM800L and the Neo-6M GPS module, with a robust backend to enable real-time vehicle tracking, efficient parking management, and sustainable transportation solutions. By leveraging modern software practices and hardware, Green Wheelz aims to contribute to a greener, healthier, and more efficient future.

Features

Real-Time Vehicle Tracking

Green Wheelz uses GPS modules (Neo-6M) integrated with the ESP32 LilyGO board to provide accurate and real-time vehicle location updates.

Cloud Integration

Location data is transmitted via the SIM800L module to a cloud-based server, ensuring seamless data flow for analysis and visualization.

Interactive Map

A React Native app displays real-time vehicle locations and parking spots on a map, offering users an intuitive interface to interact with the system.

Smart Parking

Green Wheelz allows users to reserve and navigate to the nearest available parking stations, reducing time and emissions associated with searching for parking.

Sustainable Impact

By promoting shared rides and green transportation solutions, Green Wheelz aligns with global sustainability goals to reduce carbon emissions and improve urban air quality.
