## Features

### Real-Time Vehicle Tracking
Green Wheelz uses GPS modules (Neo-6M) integrated with the ESP32 LilyGO board to provide accurate and real-time vehicle location updates.

### Cloud Integration
Location data is transmitted via the SIM800L module to a cloud-based server, ensuring seamless data flow for analysis and visualization.

### Interactive Map
A React Native app displays real-time vehicle locations and parking spots on a map, offering users an intuitive interface to interact with the system.

### Smart Parking
Green Wheelz allows users to reserve and navigate to the nearest available parking stations, reducing time and emissions associated with searching for parking.

### Sustainable Impact
By promoting shared rides and green transportation solutions, Green Wheelz aligns with global sustainability goals to reduce carbon emissions and improve urban air quality.
